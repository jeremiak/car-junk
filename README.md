Insurance data and police reports aren't good enough data sets for determining the safety of a roadway. Some accidents aren't filed with insurance, many aren't filed with the police. So we're measuring a proxy of safety: accident debris.

Debris from cars is a good sign a collision has occurred in that area or at least nearby. Taking pictures of car junk and geocoding them with a map gives us another way to advocate for vehicle mitigation methods.

The data isn't publicly available, yet, out of concerns for content moderation.
